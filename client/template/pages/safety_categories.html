        <p>	<span style="color:#339966;"><strong>LIKELY SAFE:</strong></span><br />
        	Available evidence in a renal population measures and reports safety and adverse outcomes data and consistently shows <u>no significant</u> serious adverse effects, nephrotoxicity, immunomodulation and/or drug interactions. &nbsp;In addition, the NHP is also categorized as &ldquo;likely safe&rdquo; for the general population.</p>
        <p>	<span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>POSSIBLY SAFE</strong><strong>:</strong></span><br />
        	Available evidence in a renal population measures and reports safety and adverse outcomes data but has significant methodological flaws and shows <u>no significant</u> serious adverse effects, nephrotoxicity, immunomodulation and/or drug interactions. In the absence of a study in the renal disease population, there is evidence showing safety in the general population.&nbsp; Some contrary evidence may exist; however, available evidence supporting safety outweighs contrary evidence.</p>
        <p>	<span style="color:#F79646;"><strong>POSSIBLY </strong><strong>UNSAFE:</strong></span><br />
        	Available evidence in a renal population measures and reports safety and adverse outcomes data and shows adverse effects, nephrotoxicity, immunomodulation and/or drug interactions. Some evidence of safety may exist; however, available evidence supporting potential negative concerns outweigh evidence of safety.&nbsp; In the absence of a study in the renal population, there is evidence showing potential harm in the general population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>	<span style="color:#FF0000;"><strong>UNSAFE:</strong></span><br />
        	Available evidence in a renal population measures and reports safety and adverse outcomes data and consistently shows significant serious adverse effects, nephrotoxicity, immunomodulation and/or drug interactions. In the absence of a study in the renal population, there is evidence of definite harm in the general population.</p>
